== Description ==<br>
This plugin adds the site icon option to Settings -> General.

If you disable or do not use the customizer, then you will have trouble updating the site icon. The site icon is used for favicons, and the new oEmbed feature. This plugin makes the site icon editable from the general settings page.

The plugin is a modified version of Jetpack\'s site-icon module.

Note: The plugin does not remove the ability to change the site icon from the customizer. It only adds another way to change the site icon.

== Installation ==<br>
- Install
- Activate
- Navigate to the bottom of Settings -> General
- Add/Remove site icon
